This is great it worked like a charm and my data is in the sqlite database which is great here are some questions

Question 1: the process also created 1672 canvas slides where as i think there were no canvas slides in it. even though does not matter. it ok just explain in 1 para.
oh i get it -->// Create a single empty canvas slide for each presentation (requirement #3)

Question 2: Now that my schema is in prisma schema if i want to change my database from sqlite to postgres i will have to change nothing CORRECT ?

Questoin 3: in you function importDataToSQLite you have manually created slides and items and then connected them using 

        
          // Create the EqSlide
          const createdSlide = await prisma.eqSlide.create({
            data: {
              id: slide.id,
              uuid: slide.uuid,
why ? should it not be that prisma does it something like

prisma.presentation.eqSlide.create ?????

Question 4: here is a sample file. use this to create me a file with large number of prisma client get/read examples. for example

 - read presentations with different slides types  , numbers items etc etc
